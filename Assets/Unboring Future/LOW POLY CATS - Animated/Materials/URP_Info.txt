If you are using URP, please convert the materials from built-in to URP first.

This can be achieved as follows:
- Open the Render Pipeline Converter (can be found under Window -> Rendering -> Render Pipeline Converter)
    - In the Render Pipeline Converter window, select the "Material Upgrade" and then click on "Convert Assets" (or "Initialize Converters" first)

After that, the materials should be displayed correctly.

For any questions or feedback, please write an email to "unboringfuture@gmail.com".

Enjoy the Asset!
